# ft_package

ft_package is a Python package that exists solely for the purpose of existing. It contains a function that count the number of a element in an iterable. And... that's it. Hence this package don't perform any actions, solve problems, or contribute anything meaningful to your projects. ft_package doesn't generate any output, accept any input, or require any dependencies. It's a package that embodies the essence of nothingness, making it perfect for situations where you need to include code that serves no discernible purpose.
